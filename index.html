    <h1>Race Day!</h1>
<div class="wrapper">
<p>
Codecademy’s annual race is just around the corner! This year, we have a lot of participants. You have been hired to write a program that will register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day.</p>

<p>As a timeline, registration would look like this:registration-timeline</p>

<p>Here’s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.</p>

<h3>Race number:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.</li>
  <li>All others receive a number below 1000.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Start time:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.</li>
  <li>Early adults run at 9:30 am.</li>
  <li>Late adults run at 11:00 am.</li>
  <li>Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).</li>
  <li>But we didn’t plan for runners that are exactly 18! We’ll handle that by the end of the project.</li>
</ul>
